# InvoiceFlow – Project Context

This file contains the full working context of the project so development can continue across chats without losing progress.

---

## Project Overview

InvoiceFlow is a local-first Flutter invoicing app.

Core principles:
- No backend for now
- Local-first using Hive
- Clean UI
- Multi-language support (EN / AR / FR)

---

## Tech Stack

- Flutter
- Riverpod
- Hive
- intl / l10n
- pdf
- printing
- share_plus
- image_picker
- file_selector

---

## Development Rules (CRITICAL)

- Keep Riverpod
- Keep local-first
- No backend
- Preserve current UI
- Use full file replacements
- Do not provide git commit commands until the full step is running correctly and the user confirms
- Do not update PROJECT_CONTEXT.md until the full step is running correctly and the user confirms
- Do not create new variable names when the project already has existing names for the same purpose; stick to current project naming and structure

IMPORTANT WORKFLOW RULE:
- After each completed step:
  - ALWAYS generate FULL updated PROJECT_CONTEXT.md
  - Do NOT provide partial updates
  - Do NOT require manual merging
  - Must include:
    - all completed steps
    - latest completed step
    - final outcome of the step
    - important fixes/decisions inside that step
    - current state
    - next step
- After the step is confirmed working:
  - update PROJECT_CONTEXT.md first
  - then provide git commit commands
  - both should happen together only after confirmation
- Always include the full project structure with all files so it is clear what files were added or changed
- If adding a new file, clearly say where it connects
- Prefer safe full-file replacements over partial edits

## Steps 1 to 9

Completed and working:
- Flutter project setup
- localization (EN / AR / FR)
- dashboard base
- models
- Hive local storage
- clients CRUD
- invoice and quote creation
- PDF generation
- print and share
- macOS preview
- web fallback for PDF
- business profile
- currency selector
- invoice status
- search for clients and invoices
- dashboard summary cards
- delete confirmations
- empty state polish
- localized PDF labels
- branding improvements

System stable through Step 9.

---

## Step 10 – PDF, Branding, and Arabic Handling

Completed and accepted as one phase.

Implemented:
- Arabic font added to PDF workflow
- logo upload added to business profile
- logo stored locally as base64
- logo preview added
- logo included in PDF header
- header layout reviewed and improved

Important notes:
- English and French PDF output are stable
- Arabic glyph rendering works better than before
- Arabic shaping/joining is still not solved correctly
- multiple Arabic/header layout refinements were tested
- final decision was to stop further tuning for now and keep a stable usable version

Final accepted result:
- PDF works
- branding works
- logo works
- Arabic PDF is usable but not perfect
- deeper Arabic shaping/layout improvements are deferred

---

## Step 11 – Document Numbering System

Completed as one full step.

Implemented:
- invoice prefix
- quote prefix
- next invoice number
- next quote number
- automatic numbering generation
- local persistence for numbering settings
- numbering settings UI inside Settings
- numbering integrated into invoice/quote creation flow

Important fixes included inside this same step:
- fixed crash caused by older saved settings that did not contain the new numbering values
- fixed numbering settings sheet layout so fields display correctly and do not overlap

Final accepted result:
- numbering works correctly
- prefixes save correctly
- invoice and quote numbering are separated
- values increment correctly
- settings persist locally
- UI is stable
- backward compatibility for older saved settings is handled

Note:
- Step 11 should be treated as one completed feature step, not multiple sub-steps or separate commit stages

---

## Step 12 – Backup and Restore

Completed as one full step.

Implemented:
- JSON backup export
- JSON backup restore
- backup includes:
  - clients
  - invoices
  - business profile
  - app settings
- restore performs a full local replace of current stored data
- backup/restore UI added inside Settings
- restore confirmation dialog added
- provider refresh after restore so restored data appears immediately in UI

Important fixes and decisions:
- kept the architecture local-first with Hive
- kept Riverpod architecture
- used file_selector for choosing export and restore files
- used a simple versioned JSON payload
- restore validates file shape before replacing existing data
- restore skips invalid entries without IDs instead of crashing
- settings restore writes business profile and app settings back to the settings box using the existing keys
- macOS export issue was fixed by adding the required user-selected file entitlements in:
  - macos/Runner/DebugProfile.entitlements
  - macos/Runner/Release.entitlements
- export flow was aligned with the current file_selector save dialog handling so backup export works correctly on macOS

Final accepted result:
- user can export a full local backup file
- user can restore a previous backup file
- clients, invoices, business profile, and settings are restored together
- restore immediately refreshes the app state
- UI stays simple and matches the current app style
- export works correctly on macOS after the entitlement fix

---

## Step 13 – Edit Existing Clients and Documents

Completed as one full step.

Implemented:
- edit existing clients
- edit existing invoices
- edit existing quotes
- reuse of the current add/edit screens instead of creating a separate edit flow
- invoice and quote editing keeps the original document number unchanged
- preview still opens after save for invoices and quotes
- invoice and quote list ordering now shows newest items first
- duplicate client protection added during create and edit checks

Important fixes and decisions:
- client edit was working but duplicate clients could still be created, so duplicate blocking was added using the current client fields
- invoice creation was not following the numbering system correctly, so the create flow was reconnected to the existing Step 11 numbering logic
- edit flow preserves the original invoice or quote number instead of generating a new one
- invoice list ordering was improved so the newest documents are easier to find
- preview after save was kept because it is useful and working correctly
- kept the current project naming and structure without introducing unnecessary new patterns

Final accepted result:
- clients can be edited correctly
- duplicate clients are blocked
- invoices can be edited correctly
- quotes can be edited correctly
- original invoice and quote numbers are preserved during edit
- new invoices follow the numbering system
- updated documents open in preview after save
- newest invoices are easier to find in the list
- Step 13 is complete and confirmed working

## Next Step

## Step 14 – Better Item Editing Inside Invoice and Quote Forms

Goal:
- edit existing items inside invoice and quote forms
- improve item management UX
- keep local-first architecture
- keep UI simple and safe

Preferred approach:
- allow editing an already-added item from the item list
- reuse the current add item dialog where possible
- keep totals recalculating correctly after item edit
- avoid breaking the current create/edit invoice flow

## How to Continue in New Chat

Repo: https://github.com/Mayyad78/invoiceflow
Branch: main
Last completed: Step 13
Next task: Step 14

Rules:
- keep Riverpod
- keep local-first
- no backend yet
- preserve current UI style
- always provide FULL file path
- always provide FULL code for any changed file
- do not provide partial snippets unless explicitly asked
- do not provide git commit commands until the full step is running correctly and confirmed
- do not update PROJECT_CONTEXT.md until the full step is running correctly and confirmed
- do not create new variable names if the project already has existing names for the same purpose
- after each confirmed step, update PROJECT_CONTEXT.md first, then provide git commit commands
- continue from the current architecture, do not restart the project
- if adding a new file, clearly say where it connects
- prefer safe full-file replacements over partial edits
- after each successful step, always generate the FULL updated PROJECT_CONTEXT.md file in one block
- always include the full project structure with all files after each confirmed step

## Notes

- Do not restart the project
- Continue incrementally
- Stability is more important than perfection
- Avoid breaking working features
- Step 14 should be built as one full step
