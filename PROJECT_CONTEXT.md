# InvoiceFlow – Project Context

This file contains the full working context of the project so development can continue across chats without losing progress.

---

## Project Overview
InvoiceFlow is a local-first Flutter invoicing app.

Core principles:
- No backend for now
- Local-first using Hive
- Clean UI
- Multi-language support (EN / AR / FR)

---

## Tech Stack
- Flutter
- Riverpod
- Hive
- intl / l10n
- pdf
- printing
- share_plus
- image_picker
- file_selector

---

## Development Rules (CRITICAL)
- Keep Riverpod
- Keep local-first
- No backend
- Preserve current UI
- Use full file replacements
- Do not provide git commit commands until the full step is running correctly and the user confirms
- Do not update PROJECT_CONTEXT.md until the full step is running correctly and the user confirms
- Do not create new variable names when the project already has existing names for the same purpose; stick to current project naming and structure

IMPORTANT WORKFLOW RULE:
- After each completed step:
  - ALWAYS generate FULL updated PROJECT_CONTEXT.md
  - Do NOT provide partial updates
  - Do NOT require manual merging
  - Must include:
    - all completed steps
    - latest completed step
    - final outcome of the step
    - important fixes/decisions inside that step
    - current state
    - next step
- After the step is confirmed working:
  - update PROJECT_CONTEXT.md first
  - then provide git commit commands
  - both should happen together only after confirmation
- Always include the full project structure with all files so it is clear what files were added or changed
- If adding a new file, clearly say where it connects
- Prefer safe full-file replacements over partial edits

## Steps 1 to 9

Completed and working:
- Flutter project setup
- localization (EN / AR / FR)
- dashboard base
- models
- Hive local storage
- clients CRUD
- invoice and quote creation
- PDF generation
- print and share
- macOS preview
- web fallback for PDF
- business profile
- currency selector
- invoice status
- search for clients and invoices
- dashboard summary cards
- delete confirmations
- empty state polish
- localized PDF labels
- branding improvements

System stable through Step 9.

---

## Step 10 – PDF, Branding, and Arabic Handling

Completed and accepted as one phase.

Final result:
- PDF works
- branding works
- logo works
- Arabic PDF usable but not perfect

---

## Step 11 – Document Numbering System

Completed as one full step.

Final result:
- numbering stable and working

---

## Step 12 – Backup and Restore

Completed as one full step.

Final result:
- backup/restore fully working

---

## Step 13 – Edit Existing Clients and Documents

Completed as one full step.

Final result:
- edit flows work correctly
- no duplicates
- numbering preserved

---

## Step 14 – Item Editing Inside Invoice and Quote Forms

Completed as one full step.

Final result:
- items editable
- totals recalc correctly

---

## Step 15 – Payment Tracking

Completed as one full step.

Final result:
- paid / partial / remaining working

---

## Step 16 – Client Details

Completed as one full step.

Final result:
- client financial view working

---

## Step 17 – Dashboard Upgrade

Completed as one full step.

Final result:
- real business metrics working

---

## Step 18 – Status Localization Cleanup

Completed as one full step.

Final result:
- status logic centralized
- no duplication
- PDF and UI consistent

---

## Step 19 – Quote-to-Invoice Conversion (with Fix)

Completed as one full step.

Implemented:
- convert quote → invoice
- new invoice number generated
- quote preserved
- copied:
  - client
  - items
  - tax
  - discount
  - notes
- reset payment:
  - draft
  - paid = 0
- confirmation dialog

### Fix (critical improvement):
- added `convertedInvoiceId` to quote
- quote can only be converted once
- conversion button hidden after conversion
- visual indicator shown for converted quotes
- duplicate invoice creation prevented

Final result:
- safe real-world workflow
- no duplicate invoices from same quote
- conversion fully controlled and stable

---

## Step 20 – Duplicate Invoice/Quote

Completed as one full step.

Implemented:
- duplicate existing invoice
- duplicate existing quote
- duplicate action added in invoices/quotes list
- duplicated document opens in form before saving
- new document number generated through existing numbering system
- new unique ID generated for duplicated document
- copied:
  - client
  - items
  - tax
  - discount
  - notes
- duplicated invoice resets payment state:
  - status = draft
  - paidAmount = 0
- duplicated quote remains a quote
- duplicated quote is NOT marked as converted
- issue date reset to current date
- due date recalculated from the original document timing
- edit flow preserved separately from duplicate flow

### Important fixes/decisions inside Step 20:
- kept existing project structure and naming
- preserved `InvoicesScreen(type: ...)` contract
- preserved real `InvoiceModel` fields:
  - `invoiceNumber`
  - `clientId`
  - `items`
  - `taxPercent`
  - `discount`
  - `notes`
  - `paidAmount`
  - `convertedInvoiceId`
- preserved Step 19 protection for already converted quotes
- restored provider methods expected by current screens:
  - `addInvoice`
  - `updateInvoice`
  - `deleteInvoice`
- added duplicate localization label to l10n files

Final result:
- repeated business cases are faster
- user can reuse invoices and quotes safely
- no overwrite of original document
- quote conversion safety remains intact
- duplicate workflow is stable and working
